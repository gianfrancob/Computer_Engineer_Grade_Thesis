  1 Warning CDFG-236 Detected non-positive value for replication        
                     prefix.                                            
                     The prefix expression of a replication generally   
                     must evaluate to a positive constant.  The value   
                     of a replication with a non-positive prefix        
                     depends on the setting of the attribute            
                     'hdl_zero_replicate_is_null'.  If true, the        
                     replication is treated as a zero-width             
                     expression.  If false, the replication evaluates   
                     to 1'b0.                                           
 10 Warning CDFG-472 Unreachable statements for case item.              
  6 Warning CDFG-485 Loop condition is always false.                    
                     Loop body will not be synthesized.                 
  4 Warning CDFG-508 Removing unused register.                          
                     A flip-flop or latch that was inferred for an      
                     unused signal or variable was removed. Use         
                     'set_attribute hdl_preserve_unused_registers true  
                     /' to preserve the flip-flop or latch.             
 29 Warning CDFG-818 Using default parameter value for module           
                     elaboration.                                       
  1 Warning LBR-500  Found CCS construct in one or more libraries.      
 20 Warning LBR-66   Library cell only has usable test_cell function.   
                     This library has a valid test_cell function, but   
                     its regular cell function is either missing or     
                     not completely understood (e.g. if the cell has a  
                     state_table construct).                            
 20 Warning LBR-9    Library cell has no output pins defined.           
                     Add the missing output pin(s), then reload the     
                     library. Otherwise, the library cell will be       
                     marked as unusable and as timing model.            
  1 Warning PA-17    Did not find power models for RTL power analysis.  
                     The RTL power analysis results are more accurate   
                     when detailed power models are used. Use command   
                     'build_rtl_power_models' to build detailed power   
                     models.                                            
 47 Warning PHYS-15  Wire parameter is missing.                         
                     Check the parameter in technology section.
