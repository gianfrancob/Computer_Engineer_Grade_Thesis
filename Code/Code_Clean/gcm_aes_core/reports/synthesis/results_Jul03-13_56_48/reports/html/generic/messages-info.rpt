 10 Info CDFG-250    Processing multi-dimensional arrays.               
  7 Info CDFG-372    Bitwidth mismatch in assignment.                   
 31 Info CDFG-500    Unused module input port.                          
                     The value of the input port is not used within     
                     the design.

  1 Info GLO-32      Deleting sequential instances not driving any      
                     primary outputs.                                   
                     Optimizations such as constant propagation or      
                     redundancy removal could change the connections    
                     so an instance does not drive any primary outputs  
                     anymore. To see the list of deleted sequential,    
                     set the 'information_level' attribute to 2 or      
                     above.

 20 Info LBR-170     Ignoring specified timing sense.                   
                     Timing sense should never be set with              
                     'rising_edge' or 'falling_edge' timing type.

                     The nominal operating condition represents either  
                     the nominal PVT values if specified in the         
                     library source, or the default PVT values (1.0,    
                     1.0, 1.0).
