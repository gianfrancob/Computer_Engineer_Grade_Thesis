  1 Warning CDFG-236    Detected non-positive value for replication        
                        prefix.                                            
                        The prefix expression of a replication generally   
                        must evaluate to a positive constant.  The value   
                        of a replication with a non-positive prefix        
                        depends on the setting of the attribute            
                        'hdl_zero_replicate_is_null'.  If true, the        
                        replication is treated as a zero-width             
                        expression.  If false, the replication evaluates   
                        to 1'b0.

 31   Info  CDFG-500    Unused module input port.                          
                        The value of the input port is not used within     
                        the design.

                        unused signal or variable was removed. Use         
                        'set_attribute hdl_preserve_unused_registers true  
                        /' to preserve the flip-flop or latch.

                        Optimizations such as constant propagation or      
                        redundancy removal could change the connections    
                        so an instance does not drive any primary outputs

                        The nominal operating condition represents either  
                        the nominal PVT values if specified in the

                        1.0, 1.0).                                         
  1 Warning LBR-500     Found CCS construct in one or more libraries.      
 20 Warning LBR-66      Library cell only has usable test_cell function.   
                        This library has a valid test_cell function, but   
                        its regular cell function is either missing or     
                        not completely understood (e.g. if the cell has a  
                        state_table construct).                            
 20 Warning LBR-9       Library cell has no output pins defined.           
                        Add the missing output pin(s), then reload the     
                        library. Otherwise, the library cell will be       
                        marked as unusable and as timing model.            
  1 Warning PA-17       Did not find power models for RTL power analysis.  
                        The RTL power analysis results are more accurate   
                        when detailed power models are used. Use command   
                        'build_rtl_power_models' to build detailed power   
                        models.
