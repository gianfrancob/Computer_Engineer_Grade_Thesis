  1 Warning CDFG-236    Detected non-positive value for replication        
                        prefix.                                            
                        The prefix expression of a replication generally   
                        must evaluate to a positive constant.  The value   
                        of a replication with a non-positive prefix        
                        depends on the setting of the attribute            
                        'hdl_zero_replicate_is_null'.  If true, the        
                        replication is treated as a zero-width             
                        expression.  If false, the replication evaluates   
                        to 1'b0.

                        its regular cell function is either missing or     
                        not completely understood (e.g. if the cell has a
