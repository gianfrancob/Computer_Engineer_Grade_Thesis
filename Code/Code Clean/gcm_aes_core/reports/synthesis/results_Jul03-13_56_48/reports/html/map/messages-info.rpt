  1 Info GLO-12  Replacing a flip-flop with a logic constant 0.     
                 This optimization was enabled by the root          
                 attribute 'optimize_constant_0_flops'.             
  2 Info GLO-32  Deleting sequential instances not driving any      
                 primary outputs.                                   
                 Optimizations such as constant propagation or      
                 redundancy removal could change the connections    
                 so an instance does not drive any primary outputs  
                 anymore. To see the list of deleted sequential,    
                 set the 'information_level' attribute to 2 or      
                 above.                                             
  1 Info GLO-34  Deleting instances not driving any primary         
                 outputs.                                           
                 Optimizations such as constant propagation or      
                 redundancy removal could change the connections    
                 so an instance does not drive any primary outputs  
                 anymore. To see the list of deleted instances,     
                     set the 'information_level' attribute to 2 or

  1 Info GLO-45  Replacing the synchronous part of an always        
                 feeding back flip-flop with a logic constant.      
                 The value used to replace the flop can be set by   
                 the root attribute 'optimize_seq_x_to'. The        
                 assigned constant might also conflict with the     
                 simulation and/or verification setup.              
  1 Info POPT-12 Could not find any user created clock-gating       
                 module.                                            
                 Looking for Integrated clock-gating cell in        
                 library.                                           
  1 Info POPT-92 A potential clock gating enable was not            
                 considered due to the presence of timing           
                 exceptions.                                        
                 Clock gating timing exception awareness can be     
                 disabled with the                                  
                 'lp_clock_gating_exceptions_aware' attribute.      
  1 Info POPT-96 One or more cost groups were automatically         
                 created for clock gate enable paths.               
                 This feature can be disabled by setting the        
                 attribute lp_clock_gating_auto_cost_grouping       
                 false.                                             
  4 Info ST-110  Connection established with super-threading        
                 server.                                            
                 RC is entering super-threading mode and has        
                 established a connection with a CPU server         
                 process.  This is enabled by the root attributes   
                 'super_thread_servers' or 'auto_super_thread'.     
  4 Info ST-112  A super-threading server has been shut down        
                 normally.                                          
                 A super-threaded optimization is complete and a    
                 CPU server was successfully shut down.             
  4 Info ST-120  Attempting to launch a super-threading server.     
                 RC is entering super-threading mode and is         
                 launching a CPU server process.  This is enabled   
                 by the root attribute 'super_thread_servers' or    
                 'auto_super_thread'.                               
  1 Info SYNTH-4 Mapping.                                           
  1 Info SYNTH-5 Done mapping.                                      
  1 Info WDO-600 'Conformal LEC14.2-p100' or later builds is        
                 recommended for verification.                      
                 The use of 'Conformal LEC14.2-p100' or later       
                 builds is recommended to get better verification   
                 results.
