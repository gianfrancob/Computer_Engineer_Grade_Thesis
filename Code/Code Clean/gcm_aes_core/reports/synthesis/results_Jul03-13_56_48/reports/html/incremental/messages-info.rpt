  2 Info MAP-127 Enabling some advanced optimizations in            
                 incremental optimization.                          
                 Enabling this attribute can potentially improve    
                 Qor and increase runtime.                          
483 Info POPT-56 Clock-gating instances are decloned.               
  2 Info POPT-96 One or more cost groups were automatically         
                 created for clock gate enable paths.               
                 This feature can be disabled by setting the        
                 attribute lp_clock_gating_auto_cost_grouping       
                 false.                                             
  4 Info ST-110  Connection established with super-threading        
                 server.                                            
                 RC is entering super-threading mode and has        
                 established a connection with a CPU server         
                 process.  This is enabled by the root attributes   
                 'super_thread_servers' or 'auto_super_thread'.     
  4 Info ST-112  A super-threading server has been shut down        
                 normally.                                          
                 A super-threaded optimization is complete and a    
                 CPU server was successfully shut down.             
  4 Info ST-120  Attempting to launch a super-threading server.     
                 RC is entering super-threading mode and is         
                 launching a CPU server process.  This is enabled   
                 by the root attribute 'super_thread_servers' or    
                 'auto_super_thread'.                               
  1 Info SYNTH-7 Incrementally optimizing.                          
  1 Info SYNTH-8 Done incrementally optimizing.                     
  1 Info WDO-600 'Conformal LEC14.2-p100' or later builds is        
                 recommended for verification.                      
                 The use of 'Conformal LEC14.2-p100' or later       
                 builds is recommended to get better verification   
                 results.
